# Version 3.90 - Tsugumi - 23rd May 2025

## New Features

* `GameObjects.Rectangle.setRounded` is a new method that will allow the Rectangle Shape Game Object to have rounded corners. Pass the radius to set for the corners, or pass a value of zero to disable rounded corners.
* `GameObjects.Rectangle.isRounded` is a new read-only boolean that can be used to determine if the Rectangle Shape Game Object has rounded corners, or not.
* `GameObjects.Rectangle.radius` is a new read-only number that is the size of the rounded corners. Do not set directly, instead use the method `setRounded`.
* Added `Phaser.Math.Angle.GetClockwiseDistance()` to get the shortest nonnegative angular distance between two angles. PR #7092 (thanks @samme)
* Added `Phaser.Math.Angle.GetCounterClockwiseDistance()` gets the shortest nonpositive angular distance between two angles. PR #7092 (thanks @samme)
* Added `Phaser.Math.Angle.GetShortestDistance()` gets the shortest signed angular distance between two angles. (This is like `Phaser.Math.Angle.ShortestBetween()` but in radians.) PR #7092 (thanks @samme)
* Added `Phaser.GameObjects.BitmapText#setDisplaySize` method to `BitmapText` to get the original scaled size of 1. PR #6623 (thanks @samme)
* Added fallback for Web Audio on Firefox. Firefox doesn't implement `positionX`, `positionY` and `positionZ` properties on the AudioListener instances at the moment. This prevents the follow feature from WebAudioSound to operate on Firefox. PR #7083 (thanks @raaaahman)

## Updates

* The `EXPAND` Scale Mode has been updated to now clamp the size of the canvas that is created, preventing it from growing too large on landscape ultra-wide displays. Fix #7027 (thanks @leha-games @rexrainbow)
* An Error will now be thrown if you try to create a DOM Game Object but haven't correctly configured the Game Config (thanks @samme)

## Bug Fixes

* An erroneous `console.log` was left in the Text Game Object. This has now been removed.
* Particle emitter color RGB arrays are cleared before repopulating. Fix #7069 (thanks @Golen87 @samme)
* `Phaser.Animations.AnimationFrame` correctly uses frame duration when it is set. Fix #7070 (thanks @sylvainpolletvillard)
* Particle emitter custom `moveTo` functions can now move particles. Fix #7063 (thanks @samme)
* Changed ImageCollections default Tileset values from `null` to `undefined`. Fix #7053 (thanks @Snoturky)
* Chained tweens now `persist` correctly even after calling `Phaser.Tweens.BaseTween#stop`. Fix #7048 (thanks @FranciscoCaetano88)
* New left-to-right `Text` Game Objects now includes the default `canvas.dir = 'ltr` and `context.direction = 'ltr';`. Fixes a bug in Chrome 134 & Edge 134 where calling `destroy()` on a right-to-left `Text` Game Object prevents the next created left-to-right `Text` Game Object from rendering. Fix #7077 (thanks @Demeno)
* `Grid` Game Objects renders `lineWidth` correctly in WebGL mode. Fix #7029 (thanks @AlvaroNeuronup)
* Added `collisionMask` and `collisionCategory` checks to `Phaser.Physics.Arcade.World#separate` to allow individual physics game objects within a physics group to have it's own unique collision categories. Fix #7034 (thanks @frederikocmr)
* Fixed Arcade Physics bug causing immovable circle objects to move when pushed by polygons. Fix #7054 (thanks @hunkydoryrepair)
* Fixed `createFromTiles` to handle multiple tilesets when using sprite sheets. Fix #7122 (thanks @vikerman)
* Fixed audio files not loading from Base64 data URIs (thanks @bagyoni)
